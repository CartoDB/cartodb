4.12.x (2018-05-24)
---

### NOTICE
OnPremises 2.2.0 was closed in tag 4.11.113, pointing to this commit: [a236036](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/commit/a2360360bdd42706e5fb57e3729811c41e292c5e)


### NOTICE
This release upgrades the CartoDB PostgreSQL extension to `0.22.0`. Run the following to have it available:
```shell
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/lib/sql
sudo make install
```

This release changes the way Google ouath login works. If you are using it, you need to add the client_secret
to the oauth.google_plus section of the configuration file.

### NOTICE
This releases updates the database connections, and `database.yml` needs to be updated to reflect it. The adapter
should be replaced from `postgres` to `postgresql`. See `database.yml.sample` for an example.

This upgrade changes the configuration format of basemaps. You must replace all `url` keys for `urlTemplate`. It is
recommended that you replace the `basemaps` section completely, since this release also adds supports for high
resolution maps, which have added `urlTemplate2x` keys to the configuration.

You can then run `bundle exec rake carto:db:sync_basemaps_from_app_config` to synchronize existing layers.
### NOTICE

This upgrade changes AWS gem version. Now you must specify `region` within your AWS configurations. Check `app_config.yml.sample`.

#### Dropbox API v2 migration

Dropbox API v2 (#8303, #12300): [Dropbox deprecated API v1](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2016/06/api-v1-deprecated/)
so CARTO must migrate. If you are using Dropbox integration, you must:
* Check which permission does your application has in Dropbox. If it's "Full", just upgrading CARTO is enough.
* If it's not "Full", you must:
   1. Create a new application in Dropbox, with "Full" permission.
   2. Delete existing tokens. You can do this at Rails console with `SynchronizationOauth.where(service: 'dropbox').each(&:destroy)`.
   3. Change Dropbox configuration at app_config.yml to the new application and restart server and Resque.
   4. Connect users again (at profile page).
   5. Trigger sync datasets manually.

More information at [Dropbox migration guide](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/migration-guide).

This release includes the new Builder, so it includes major changes. The logs only includes changes to editor.

### NOTICE
This release rebrands CartoDB as CARTO, so a few maintenance tasks have to be run:
 - `bundle exec rake carto:db:set_carto_attribution`
 - Update basemaps configuration to use CARTO as a category instead of CartoDB

### NOTICE
This release introduces a new Resque queue: `user_dbs`. It is needed for operation on user databases, i.e: linking
ghost tables, importing common data and automatic index creation.

### NOTICE
This release changes the way visualization tokens are stored, so am igration task has to be run for password
protected visualizations to keep working: `bundle exec rake cartodb:vizs:update_auth_tokens`

### NOTICE
PostgreSQL 9.5 is needed.

### NOTICE
This release upgrades the CartoDB PostgreSQL extension to `0.18.1`. Run the following to have it available:
```shell
cd $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/lib/sql
sudo make install
```

### Features
* Automatic creation of indexes on columns affected by a widget
* Update CartoDB PostgreSQL extension to 0.18.1:
  * Change CDB_ZoomFromScale() to use a formula and raise
    maximum overview level from 23 to 29. (0.16.4)
    [#259](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb-postgresql/pull/259)
  * Fix bug in overview creating causing it to fail when `x` or
    `y` columns exist with non-integer type. Prevent also
    potential integer overflows limiting maximum overview level
    to 23.
    [#258](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb-postgresql/pull/258) (0.16.4)
  * Add export config for cdb_analysis_catalog table (0.17.0)
  * Add some extra fields to cdb_analysis_catalog table. Track user, error_message for failures, and last entity modifying the node (0.17.0)
  * Exclude overviews from user data size (0.17.0)
  * Add cache_tables column to cdb_analysis_catalog table (0.17.1)
  * Fix: exclude NULL geometries when creating Overviews (0.18.0)
  * Function to check analysis tables limits (0.18.0)
  * Exclude analysis cache tables from the quota (0.18.0)
  * Increase analysis limit factor to 2 [#284](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb-postgresql/pull/284) (0.18.1)
* Viewer users for organizations.
* Oauth integration with GitHub
* Configurable [Redis timeouts: connect_timeout, read_timeout, write_timeout](https://github.com/redis/redis-rb#timeouts).
* Configurable paths for logs and configurations through environment variables. If not set, they default to `Rails.root` as usual.
  * `RAILS_CONFIG_BASE_PATH`. Example: /etc/carto
  * `RAILS_LOG_BASE_PATH`. Example: /tmp/carto
  Both are replacements for `Rails.root` and expect the same internal structure so, for example,
  if you place `app_config.yml` at `/etc/carto/config/app_config.yml`, `RAILS_CONFIG_BASE_PATH` must be `/etc/carto`.
    The same happens with logs, which are stored into `#{RAILS_LOG_BASE_PATH}/logs/filename.log`).
    This way those variables can be a drop-in replacement for `Rails.root`, guaranteeing compatibility with Rails project structure.
* Configurable path for public uploads:
  * `RAILS_PUBLIC_UPLOADS_PATH`. Example: /var/carto/assets. Defaults to `env_app_config[:importer]["uploads_path"]`
  This will store user uploaded assets at `#{RAILS_PUBLIC_UPLOADS_PATH}/uploads` (needed for backwards compatibility).
* Don't display Twitter or MailChimp if user can't import it.
* Updated ogr2ogr version to 2.1.1, configurable in `app_config.yml`. To install it in the system:
  * `sudo apt-get update`
  * `sudo apt-get install gdal2.1-static-bin`
  * edit your `config/app_config.yml` and make sure the `ogr2ogr` entry contains the following `binary: 'which ogr2ogr2.1'`. See [app_config.yml.sample](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/blob/0529b291623a9d9d78c8f21ff201f9938aa51aca/config/app_config.yml.sample#L8) for an example.
* Salesforce and ArcGIS connectors can now be enabled independently of `cartodb_com_hosted` (in the `datasources` section in `app_config.yml.sample`)
* Custom labels for legends (#10763)
* Builder is enabled by default
* New option for centering the map according a layer data (#10116).

### Bug Fixes
* Incorrect error message when password validation failed
* Fix visualization not found error when exporting maps created from datasets

* Several auth_token related fixes
* Fix issue importing/duplicating maps where the original had an incomplete map.options
* New builder default geometry styles are now properly initialized at the backend upon dataset import.
* Fixed list of layers in Add basemap WMS URL tab
* This release introduces the Magic Positioner helper to render context menus in the best position inside the viewport.
* Removed non used fonts (Lato and Proxima Nova) and the font loader.
* Fixed problem generating Histogram stats in columns with only one value (#9737).
* 'Clear' button in SQL view shows up if the first SQL edition fails (#9869).
* Minimum buckets is 2 for histogram widgets (#10645).
* Fixed with category widgets and aggregation (#10773)

3.13.0 (2016-XX-XX)
-------------------
### NOTICE
For the analysis catalog feature existing users require to run `rake cartodb:db:set_user_privileges_in_cartodb_schema['$USERNAME']`.

### NOTICE
This release introduces a different method of doing cache invalidations, using Surrogate Keys instead of the older X-Cache-Channel header.
See [CartoDB Surrogate Keys](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/wiki/CartoDB-Surrogate-Keys) on the wiki for more information about this change.

All invalidations done from newly created CartoDB accounts/databases from this release will invalidate using the new method.
Due to this, if you use Varnish or any alternate caching methods, you need to update to a version of the APIs which provides a Surrogate-Keys header on all the cacheable responses:
  * Windshaft-cartodb >= 2.27.0
  * CartoDB-SQL-API >= 1.26.0

After ensuring those applications are updated, you should restart Varnish (or purge all its objects) to ensure all new objects will contain
the Surrogate-Keys header, and then reload the invalidation trigger installed on the user databases to be upgraded with the Rake task: `rake cartodb:db:load_varnish_trigger`.

For backwards compatibility with unupgraded trigger versions, those API versions still emit both X-Cache-Channel and Surrogate-Key headers.
However, this will be deprecated on a future release.

### NOTICE
This release changes how visualization permissions are stored in the database. To ensure that the database state is consistent,
it is highly recommended to run the following rake task BEFORE MIGRATING the database schema: `rake cartodb:permissions:fill_missing_permissions`.

The task will report visualization that could not be automatically fixed, where multiple permissions exists for a given visualization,
which should be fixed manually.

### Features
* Update CartoDB PostgreSQL extension to 0.16.3:
  * Support for analysis catalog (0.16.0)
  * Schema quoting bugfix for overviews (0.16.3)
* Change Varnish table-related invalidations and tagging to use [Surrogate Keys](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/wiki/CartoDB-Surrogate-Keys)
* Remove Varnish table invalidations from Rails and replaced them with CDB_TableMetadataTouch calls (delegating invalidation responsibility to the database)
* Adds optional strong passwords for organization signups
* Improved logging for custom installations where Rollbar is not used
* Add new function User#direct_db_connection which uses a new direct_port paramerer to be specified in database.yml to connect to the database. Usage instructions:
  * Use `port` in database.yml to specify the port through which the db is accessed for regular queries (such as pgbouncer connections)
  * Use `direct_port` in database.yml to specify the port through which the db can be directly accessed (i.e. the port in which Postgres is running)
  * This change is backwards compatible and will fallback to `port` whenever `direct_port` is not specified in the database configuration file.
* Update ogr2ogr version to 2.1, configurable in `app_config.yml`. To install it in the system, run:
  * `sudo apt-get install gdal2.1-static-bin`
* Added config option `avatars.gravatar_enabled` to disabled gravatar loading (i.e: in offline installations)
* Ghost table linking is now concurrent per user (avoids race conditions)
* Experimental support for [visualization metadata export](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/7114).
* Full visualization export (metadata + data). Example: `bundle exec rake cartodb:vizs:export_full_visualization['5478433b-b791-419c-91d9-d934c56f2053']` (replace the id with the visualization that you want to export).
  * New configuration parameter: `exporter.exporter_temporal_folder`. Default value: `/tmp/exporter`. See `app_config.yml.sample`.
  * Geopackage internal format.
* Full visualization export API. Needed configuration changes:
  * New Resque queue: `exports`.
  * `exporter.uploads_path`. Set it to `public/uploads` to use Rails standard upload directory or an absolute path (such as `/tmp/export/downloads`) to make cleanup easier.
  * `s3` (see `exporter.s3` at `app_config.yml.sample`).
  * Enabled `config.action_dispatch.x_sendfile_header = 'X-Accel-Redirect'` for nginx direct download if you''re not using S3. Needs [ngnix configuration](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/start/topics/examples/x-accel). `uploads_path` configuration path is used.
* Update CartoDB PostgreSQL extension to 0.15.1 to support overviews.
* Disables data library when it is not configured (e.g: offline installations).
* Disables external file services when not configured (e.g: offline installations).
* Update dataservices-api client to version 0.3.0 (routing functions).
* Migration from wizard properties to style properties.

* Removing Bitly shortener.


3.11.0 (2015-09-09)
-------------------
* Synchronizations model now has a new field (and FK) to visualizations.id and joins to them using that instead of by matching name to canonical visualization's table name. It also gets deleted if FK dissapears.
* Code also switches to using syncrhonizations.visualization_id for linking, so in order to have back existing synchronizations, the following rake needs to be run: `bundle exec rake cartodb:populate_synchronization_visualization_ids`
* StatsD data gathering refactored. Check /lib/cartodb/stats for details
* Data library feature is not cartodb user dependent anymore. By default the username you defined in the common-data config section, will be used with your base url to query for public datasets to build your own data-library based on that user. You can define the `base_url` property and point to other domain to retreive the public datasets from that user. For example set to `https://common-data.cartodb.com` you are going to keep using the cartodb data-library. Please refer to the example configuration file (app_config.yml.sample) `common_data`section  to check how it could be configured
* New modals (removing old code & feature flag restricting access to new ones) [#5068](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5068)
* Updated (most of) frontend dependencies [#5171](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5171)
* Metadata is editable when datasets have a SQL Query is applied [#5195](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5195)
* LDAP configuration & authentication system. If active deactivates standard CartoDB & Google authentications. See cartodb:ldap:create_ldap_configuration rake for how to create one, and source code of /app/models/carto/ldap for more details.
* Upgrade cartodb-postgresql extension to 0.9.4, which includes the new cartodbfy process. As part of this change new user tables won't have the columns `created_at` nor `updated_at`. See the [release notes](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb-postgresql/blob/0.9.4/NEWS.md) for more details.
* Added code coverage generation for tests suite. After a run, results will be stored at `coverage` subfolder
* Organizations can choose their authentication mechanisms.
* Fixed street addr tab for georeference modal for google maps/geocoder usage [#5281](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5281)
* Privacy toggler within create dataset dialog [#5340](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5340)
* Fixed maps disappearing after creation + navigation to dashboard [#5264](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/issues/5264)
* Log.append now allows to disable truncating (by default active)
* Detection of lat/long columns now is done in `ogr2ogr2` rather than rails code [#5349](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5349). In order to get this feature working (and some related tests), execute this to get the ogr2ogr2 package updated: `sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade`. From this version on, the ogr2ogr2 package is mandatory. In order to install it: `sudo apt-get install ogr2ogr2-static-bin`.
* Removed Mixpanel tracking code [#5410](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/pull/5410)
* Newly imported datasets now properly calculate the map bounds and zoom and store them
* Don't try to short url with bitly if credentials are not present in app_config.yml

#### Steps to avoid problems with submodules changes
```shell
# Before get last changes from master, let's remove the
# common submodule
git submodule deinit app/assets/stylesheets/common

"Link-only" state. To do this, just run the following SQL query on your metadata

```
UPDATE visualizations
SET privacy='link'
WHERE privacy='public';

IMPORTANT NOTE
==============
From this release, CartoDB uses UUIDs instead of IDs to reference to all objects on
the database, so that it is being able to work on distributed environments much
reliably.

Your database would need manual upgrade in order to use this CartoDB version.

We have created a script to help you migrate your database. Even this script has
been tested on production environments by us, we highly encourage
to make a FULL backup of your database before running it.
This backup should involve both PostgreSQL metadata and user data databases
and redis metadata database.

In order to run this migration you need to stop your application and make sure
that there is not any connection to your databases while you run the script.

After you run the migration script manually you will need to run the rails
migration task as usual.
This migration will detect that your database is already in the right state and will
continue normally (and won't work until you do so).

Notice that this migration is mandatory in order to use this CartoDB version
and any other future version. Also, versions starting with this one are
incompatible with the old database schema with integer based ids.

These are the steps you need to follow in order to run the manual script:
```
  $ cd <application_root>
  $ export RAILS_ENV=<rails_env>
  $ export DBNAME=<your_postgresql_database_name>
  $ export DBHOST=<your_postgresql_database_host>
  $ export DBUSER=<your_postgresql_database_user>
  $ export DBPORT=<your_postgresql_database_port>
  $ export REDIS_HOST=<your_redis_host>
  $ bundle exec ruby ./script/migrate_to_uuid.rb schema
  $ bundle exec ruby ./script/migrate_to_uuid.rb meta
  $ bundle exec ruby ./script/migrate_to_uuid.rb data
  $ bundle exec ruby ./script/migrate_to_uuid.rb clean
```
