## Support Options

Feeling stuck? There are many ways to find help.

* Ask a question on [GIS StackExchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/carto) using the `CARTO` tag.
* [Report an issue](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto.js/issues) in Github.
* Enterprise Plan customers have additional access to enterprise-level support through CARTO's support representatives.

If you just want to describe an issue or share an idea, just <a class="typeform-share" href="https://cartohq.typeform.com/to/mH6RRl" data-mode="popup" target="_blank"> send your feedback</a><script>(function() { var qs,js,q,s,d=document, gi=d.getElementById, ce=d.createElement, gt=d.getElementsByTagName, id="typef_orm_share", b="https://embed.typeform.com/"; if(!gi.call(d,id)){ js=ce.call(d,"script"); js.id=id; js.src=b+"embed.js"; q=gt.call(d,"script")[0]; q.parentNode.insertBefore(js,q) } })() </script>.

### Issues on Github

If you think you may have found a bug, or if you have a feature request that you would like to share with the CARTO.js team, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cartodb/carto.js/issues/new). 

Before opening an issue, review the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CartoDB/carto.js/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#filling-a-ticket).


### Community support on GIS Stack Exchange

GIS Stack Exchange is the most popular community in the geospatial industry. This is a collaboratively-edited question and answer site for geospatial programmers and technicians. It is a fantastic resource for asking technical questions about developing and maintaining your application.

Members of the CARTO.js team regularly monitor the `carto` tag. You can look for CARTO topics by adding `carto` or `carto.js` to your search query. You can also add additional tags to your question in order to attract the attention of experts in related technologies.


When posting a new question, please consider the following:

* Read the GIS Stack Exchange [help](https://gis.stackexchange.com/help) and [how to ask](https://gis.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) pages for guidelines and tips about posting questions.
* Be very clear about your question in the subject. A clear explanation helps those trying to answer your question, as well as those who may be looking for information in the future.
* Be informative in your post. Details, code snippets, logs, screenshots, etc. help others to understand your problem.
* Use code that demonstrates the problem. It is very hard to debug errors without sample code to reproduce the problem.

### Enterprise Plan Customers

Enterprise Plan customers have additional support options beyond general community support. As per your account Terms of Service, you have access to enterprise-level support through CARTO's support representatives available at [enterprise-support@carto.com](mailto:enterprise-support@carto.com)

In order to speed up the resolution of your issue, provide as much information as possible (even if it is a link from community support). This allows our engineers to investigate your problem as soon as possible.

If you are not yet CARTO customer, browse our [plans & pricing](https://carto.com/pricing/) and find the right plan for you.
