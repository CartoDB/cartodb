SQL files in this directory (*.sql) will be loaded into newly
created user databases.

You can install/upgrade functions in all known users databases
with the cartodb:db:load_function rake target:

  rake cartodb:db:load_functions

The test/ directory contains regression testing for the functions
you can run against all user databases using:

  rake cartodb:db:test_functions

This is how you can upgrade & test functions in a single run:

  rake cartodb:db:load_functions cartodb:db:test_functions
