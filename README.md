CARTO is an open, powerful, and intuitive platform for discovering and predicting the key insights underlying the location data in our world.

Empower organizations to optimize operational performance, strategic investments, and everyday decisions with CARTO Engine—our embeddable platform for web and mobile apps—and the new CARTO Builder, a drag and drop analysis tool.

It was built to make it easier for people to tell their stories by
providing them with flexible and intuitive ways to create maps and design
geospatial applications. CARTO can be installed on your own server
and we also offer a hosted service at [carto.com](https://carto.com).

If you would like to see some live demos, check out our

We hope you like it!

## What can I do with CARTO?

With CARTO, you can upload your geospatial data (Shapefiles, GeoJSON,
etc) using a web form and then make it public or private.

After it is uploaded, you can visualize it in a dataset or on a map, search
it using SQL, and apply map styles using CartoCSS. You can even access it
using the CARTO [APIs](https://docs.carto.com/#cartodb-platform), or export it
to a file.

In other words, with CARTO you can make awesome maps and build
powerful geospatial applications! Definitely check out the [CARTO
Platform](https://carto.com/platform) for interactive examples
and code.
