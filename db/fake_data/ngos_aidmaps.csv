ActionAid supports poor people’s rights and needs, working at a practical level to improve access to basic services. We also lobby the government and others for changes to the policies and practices that affect poor people’s lives. With our projects, we are able to guarantee access to food supply, treated water, health services and education for people living in poverty both in Port-au-Prince and rural areas.

After the devastating earthquake in January 2010, ActionAid concentrated its efforts and resources on providing food for more than 3,000 families and distributing other emergency relief items such as blankets, kitchen equipment, toothbrushes, towels and clothing. We have also trained community volunteers to help with emotional care.

Four months later, ActionAid is focusing on Haiti’s rehabilitation plan. A three-year earthquake response and rehabilitation plan covers immediate needs, shelter, livelihoods, education, disaster risk reduction, policy and governance.

Over the next few months, we will be moving from emergency relief to medium-term interventions such as cash/food for work, livelihoods initiatives and strengthening our work on psychosocial and protection. We are also planning on building a number of transitional shelters and developing a strategy to help relocate earthquake survivors.

ActionAid’s three-year reconstruction program focuses on provision of psychosocial support to our partner organizations and communities, shelter/housing, livelihoods, women’s rights, protection for internally displaced persons (IDPs) and vulnerable populations, education, disaster risk reduction and advocacy around official reconstruction policy.","The number of rights-holders reached is defined through our participatory approach involving ActionAid, the partner organization and the communities themselves.

Responding to the ongoing  Haitian crisis, AFSC’s objectives for its work in Haiti are twofold:  when needed to deliver humanitarian assistance that secures basic human rights and restores livelihoods; and to strengthen urban communities, institutions and strategic stakeholders to resolve problems peacefully.

In partnership with two local NGOs AFSC is working on the implementation of two pilot projects. The primary goal of the two projects is to enhance the well-being and physical security of displaced persons residing in urban camps/shelters in Port-au-Prince and Leogane. Special emphasis is given to strengthening local capacities to manage conflicts and reduce violence.  As a part of these projects AFSC will facilitate intensive training in trauma healing which will be given to the staff working in the communities of the two projects and key community leadership members.","The two pilot projects will reach approximately 4,958 families (information from early September 2010.)

As grantmakers, AJWS’s strategy is to provide holistic, long-term, flexible support to grassroots organizations and strategic allies in rural and urban Haiti. AJWS is working with grantees to respond effectively to immediate and emerging needs after the earthquake and engage in established community-based social change efforts to advance human rights and address community needs. With this in mind, AJWS’s specific objectives in Haiti are to ensure that:
•   Women, youth, farmers and people with disabilities in urban and rural areas have profitable businesses and access to income-generating opportunities.
•   Haitians, in the areas where AJWS grantees work, have greater access to and control over food production.
•   Women, including survivors of gender-based violence, sexually diverse communities, farmers, youth and people with disabilities in urban and rural areas of Haiti, are healthier, safer and more secure.
•   Grassroots organizations and movements in urban and rural Haiti are stronger, more stable, better networked, benefit from foreign assistance and are part of post-earthquake decision-making and monitoring processes.

Having supported community-based organizations in Haiti for over a decade, AJWS was able to provide emergency relief grants within 48 hours following the earthquake. The funding initially supported the immediate rescue efforts of our existing network of grantees in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, enabling them to meet immediate community needs for food, water, medicine and emergency health services. Through the Haiti Earthquake Relief Fund, AJWS will continue to support its network of grantees as they address immediate and emerging needs.

Given AJWS’s experience responding to other natural disasters like the Indian Ocean tsunami in 2004 and conflict-related violence, we have learned that post-disaster recovery and development takes time. AJWS has made a commitment of at least four years to support the recovery and reconstruction of communities throughout Haiti. AJWS will also transition selected emergency grantees into core grantees, which will receive long-term funding for community development and rights promotion projects aimed at addressing food sovereignty, community health, economic justice and civic and political participation.",The number of people reached is calculated based on each AJWS grantee’s response through its individual monitoring and evaluation process.,"$6,000,000 ",,,"$1,200,000 ",,,,,,,,,Amarilys Estrella,Program Officer,(212)-792-2838,,Joshua Berkman,Media and Marketing,(212)-792-2893,jberkman@ajws.org,"45 West 36th Street, 10th Fl",,New York,NY,10018,212-792-2900,http://www.ajws.org/haitiearthquake

CRS has developed a comprehensive, long-term response to adjust ongoing programming based on this crisis and to help those most affected by the disaster to rebuild their lives and communities. This strategy frames the relief and development interventions as well as approaches to engage the Catholic constituency in the U.S. in the Haitian journey to recovery.

The guiding principles of Catholic Social Teaching are the foundation of this CRS response. CRS and partners adhere to principles of solidarity, human dignity, good stewardship and subsidiarity through approaches that promote full transparency and accountability. Key elements of this approach include: recognition of the role of the Haitian Church as an agent for change; empowerment of Haitians in their own recovery; long-term commitment; need for a flexible approach; and a holistic response that considers the integral needs of the population.

CRS GOAL: 
Haitians live dynamic, productive and dignified lives.

Leadership development, protection, disaster risk reduction, advocacy and accountability are critical programming considerations with specific activities threaded throughout each sector.
Catholic Relief Services (CRS) and partners mobilized within hours of the disaster to begin assessing needs and providing relief.  Since those early days, CRS has expanded in order to reach more people, and to strengthen programs in a variety of sectors.  To date, some key achievements include the following: 
•   Provided food to nearly 900,000 people.  Currently providing food to more than 90,000 students in over 270 schools, and monthly food rations to more than 100 orphanages and child-care centers in Port-au-Prince and Les Cayes, benefiting nearly 10,000 children.
•   Provided emergency shelter materials to more than 215,000 people.
•   Performed over 974 emergency operations and conducted 64,000 outpatient consultations.
•   Employed approximately 10,000 people in Cash-for-Work activities that are designed both to provide income to vulnerable people and benefit communities.
•   Installed over 600 latrines, hand-washing stations, potable water tanks and inflatable water bladders in Port-au-Prince and environs.
•   Established five “child-friendly spaces” for unaccompanied children at camps, regularly attended by more than 1,900 children.
•   Provided 5,939 families with livelihood support and the dignity of choice through vouchers that allow them to choose the most appropriate types of seeds and fertilizers—this approach also benefits local seed suppliers and stimulates local markets.

Habitat for Humanity International,http://www.habitat.org,,"In the first six months after the earthquake, Habitat for Humanity Haiti supported early recovery with emergency shelter kits, assessments of damaged houses and construction of transitional shelters. For the remainder of 2010, our focus is on transitional shelters.  Beginning in 2011, our focus will remain on delivery of transitional shelters but also include repairs and retrofits, upgradable t-shelters and constructing core houses.

Key principles guide our strategy: 
•   Provide people with a pathway to permanence; 
•   Employ a collaborative approach that includes the involvement of beneficiary families as well as the community; and 
•   Engage in strong partnerships to provide community-wide solutions, including water, sanitation and secure land.

Habitat is implementing its Haiti recovery project through community-based Habitat Resource Centers (HRCs). HRCs respond to the needs of households within their service area, providing a range of services that include damage assessments, repairs and retrofits, assistance in securing land and tenure, loans of tools and equipment, materials fabrication, water and sanitary solutions, transitional shelter and shelter upgrades.  As the recovery progresses, housing finance will be introduced so that families can continue to manage home improvements and additions.

In responding to housing needs, HRCs identify gaps and deficiencies in the local housing production process. The analysis looks at local design preferences, quality of materials and tools, availability of skilled labor and technical expertise within the cultural and political framework. Through the HRC, new designs are developed with community input, materials are sourced and fabricated. Training is offered in construction skills, disaster preparedness and other subjects like financial literacy or health and hygiene.

HRC activities support the development and sustainability of the local construction sector—as well as economic recovery—with job creation and business development. They improve the quality of construction to mitigate against the effects of future disasters.

Habitat for Humanity has set high goals and standards for its five-year recovery project in Haiti. In addition to the goal of serving 50,000 families is the goal of building the capacity of Habitat for Humanity Haiti to carry on the work in the years ahead, to help ever more families along the pathway to permanent housing and to be a catalyst for positive change in construction, community development and land rights in Haiti.",Habitat calculates beneficiaries served based on the average Haitian family size of five members; thus each housing solution serves an estimated five beneficiaries.,"$11,511,664 ",33%,67%,"$7,125,145 ",31%,69%,"$2,979,063 ","$2,320,546 ","$1,977,161 ","$1,171,409 ",23,72,Duane Bates,Director Public Relations and New Media,(404)-733-3079,,,,,,270 Peachtree st.

In addition to the injuries directly caused by the earthquake, the indirect health effects of the earthquake included the spread of infections and communicable diseases resulting from people living in crowded spontaneous settlements. Heartland Alliance addressed the immediate medical and psychosocial needs of earthquake survivors by establishing a level two field clinic for internally displaced people living in and around the national stadium. 
Heartland Alliance’s focus in Haiti is mainly in the domain of Child Protection. Shortly after the earthquake, Heartland Alliance’s Family Tracing and Reunification Program was created to identify  and register separated children in regional hospitals in Port-au-Prince, with the goal to reunite them with a family member. This program has recently expanded to include the Les Cayes region. 
Heartland Alliance has another program that is currently providing trained Child Protection Officers at principal Haitian border crossings to assist the Government of Haitiís (GoH) Child Protection in screening, identifying and registering children crossing the borders at Ouinaminthe, Belladere, Malpasse and Anse-a-Pitres. 
Heartland Alliance has a community-based psychosocial program based in Petit Goave which trains community workers in how to identify and give presentations to local community groups in identifying symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress. 
Heartland Alliance has a team of youth organizers that travel to under-served IDP camps to jumpstart and reinforce structured recreational activities there.  Heartland Alliance staff meet with local camp management committees and community groups to identify youth leadership and discuss concepts planning for game/sports programs for children there including needs and hopes, space constraints, storage of materials to be provided, and scheduling.  After initial planning, Heartland Alliance provides community leaders with balls, jump ropes, jerseys, and other recreational materials for use in the camps both on an informal lending basis and as part of more structured activities.  Heartland Alliance organizers then make follow-up visits to ensure materials are used equitably and appropriately, and discuss with youth and community leaders to address any challenges and define future plans. To date, Heartland Alliance has achieved the following: 3 IDP camps provided with recreational materials and planning support to start community-based recreational programs run by local teens.","The number of people reached through the project is calculated to include all people who have benefited from Heartland Alliance interventions.

LWR responded immediately to the January 12 earthquake with a $750,000 contribution to the Action by Churches Together (ACT) appeal to support the distribution of water, food and non-food items in and around Port-au-Prince and heavily affected nearby cities. LWR also shipped over $1,000,000 worth of material resources from its stockpiles, including quilts, layettes, health kits and school kits. Tarps and tents valued at $400,000 were also procured and shipped to ACT partners to distribute for temporary shelter needs.

LWR’s relief phase has also included support to local partners to assist rural communities in departments to the north of Port-au-Prince that have been overwhelmed by a sudden influx of internally displaced persons. This short-term support includes cash-for-work programs, assistance in ensuring safe water supply, sanitation (latrine construction) and training of internally displaced people (IDPs) and host communities in monitoring and treatment of dehydration, acute diarrheal diseases and other common illnesses.

As of September, LWR has provided the following relief assistance: 29,585 health kits, 25,545 quilts, 1,500 layettes and 16,875 tarps. LWR has also provided $1,130,000 to partners to provide food, water, sanitation, shelter, basic health care, cash-for-work and seeds.

In the rehabilitation phase, LWR’s long-term plans include support to both current and new partners through three-to-five-year projects that focus primarily on helping communities that are hosting large numbers of IDPs from Port-au-Prince and other earthquake-ravaged areas. Anticipated activities will focus on:
1. Increasing food availability through improved and expanded agricultural production, support to seed banks and other rural livelihoods initiatives;
2. Ensuring adequate access to water, through the construction of water systems and hygiene facilities;
3. Strengthening the capacity of local farmer- and community-based organizations to meet the needs of IDPs;
4. Distribution of material resources from LWR’s own stock (including school supplies); and
5. Capacity building in Disaster Risk Reduction for community groups.","LWR conducted initial needs assessments in collaboration with our local partners in Haiti in order to identify appropriate target populations.

MAP International,http://www.map.org,,"With its extensive network of medical partnerships and over 40 years of service to healthcare providers in Haiti, MAP International quickly assembled its emergency relief response for many of the Haitian men, women and children devastated by the powerful 7.3 earthquake. Health systems, food supply, roads, electricity, communications, and other vital infrastructure have all been severely impaired or destroyed by the earthquake. The sea port and airport have both experienced heavy damage as well as high levels of humanitarian aid traffic. Haiti has become a high-profile emergency within MAP’s media profiling, with statements being sent out to supporters, donors and other agency networks (including the Global Relief Alliance).

Our first strategic response was primarily to support NGO partners with medical aid shipments.  These medicines and supplies support long-term MAP field partnerships in Haiti – NGOs who have linkages to existing health networks and in-country capacity for warehousing and logistics. These partners had already mobilized field hospitals and clinics to triage the injured and provide other types of assistance. They then adjusted health care strategies to account for the shift in needs. Our partners then focused more on post-operative care, infections of untreated wounds, diseases of crowded conditions, and the ongoing primary health care needs. Numerous medical aid shipments were shipped from the MAP Distribution Center situated strategically on the southern Atlantic Coast. Altogether, the first shipments had the potential to impact over half the people in and around Port-au-Prince, and the subsequent shipments had the potential to support all the treatments that are required.  In addition, medicines and supplies donated specifically for the relief continued to stream into the MAP Distribution Center.

MAP International’s current plans for the disaster in Haiti:  After the immediate short and medium term response MAP wants to engage in long-term plans. Besides the provision of essential medicines, it is pursuing the support to recover the government health care system, strengthen rehabilitation activities for people affected – as well as the development of the programs that leads toward Total Health Villages to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. The thrust of the strategy is Relief to Rehabilitation, and furthering the continuum into long-term sustainable development.","The number of beneficiaries was estimated by the number of treatments projected from medical shipments in all phases of the Haiti Relief effort.  A reasonable assumption is made that each patient on the average requires three different treatments.  In the past, MAP had conducted an assessment of all medical shipments and arrived at an estimated number of treatments in each type of delivery method (palletized shipments & MAP Travel Packs).  This number of treatments is an estimate only from a sampling of past shipments – the actual number of treatments for each shipment may vary considerably since the contents of the shipments also varies, depending on availability of specific medicines and supplies.  

It would not be feasible to calculate actual numbers of persons treated in a relief effort, so the average number of treatments per individual is used as a proxy for beneficiary numbers.  It would be especially difficult to calculate unduplicated beneficiary numbers (if the same patient returned for multiple treatment visits).  A detailed patient record-keeping system would be required (not feasible in a relief situation) to identify.  Ultimately, the average number of treatments per person is at best an approximation of the total number of beneficiaries served by the project.","$978,653 ",97%,3%,"$978,653 ",97%,3%,,,,,,1,Scott Ruschak,"Director, International Medical Resources",(912)-280-6646,,Scott Ruschak,"Director, International Medical Resources",(912)-280-6646,sruschak@map.org,4700 Glynco Parkway,,Brunswick,GA,31525,800-225-8550,http://www.map.org

Medical Teams International,http://www.medicalteams.org,,"Since 1998, Medical Teams International has sent 51 volunteer medical teams to help improve the health and well being of tens of thousands of Haitians.  Medical Teams International has worked in close partnership with the Haiti Foundation of Hope (HFH) to support a rural health clinic in Terre Blanche, a small village north of Gonaïves. In partnership with HFH, MTI has provided technical support to train 30 local leaders in community health needs assessment, baseline survey, and program planning. In response to the earthquake, MTI provided matching funds to HFH for an earthquake disaster response project to deliver seeds and fertilizer to farmers, and to construct new wells.  MTI also deployed disaster response teams to the north of Haiti with HFH after the hurricanes in 2004 and 2008.

Since January 2010, in response to the earthquake, Medical Teams International has served over 183,600 beneficiaries through mobile medical units and static clinics (20,800 served) and through donations of Gifts-in-Kind (162,800 served).  MTI also shipped more than $5 million in medicines and supplies, developed a psychosocial training program, and established a field office to transition from relief to rehabilitation and development. The following provides detail on Medical Teams International’s interventions in response to the earthquake.

A.  Emergency Medical and Primary Health Care 
Medical Teams International’s mission in Haiti is to provide emergency and primary health care to earthquake-affected communities throughout Haiti, improving the quality of life from relief through recovery. During the first 24 weeks after the earthquake, Medical Teams International sent 18 volunteer teams with the first one arriving within three days of the disaster. More than 100 doctors, nurses and other health professionals have been operating out of mobile medical units and static clinics in Port-au-Prince, Léogâne, Les Cayes and Carrefour.

Medical Teams International also partnered with the Quisqueya Project.  Through this project, in the first 6 months after the earthquake, 60,000 patients were treated, $4.5 million in supplies were distributed, and 1,500 medical personnel were deployed to care for earthquake affected individuals.

Our current health programs include (1) static clinic services for the provision of primary health care and prevention services; (2) psychosocial training to help address post-disaster trauma needs; (3) rehabilitation services through our Advantage Program, which aims to meet the physical and spiritual needs of persons with disabilities; and (4) support to church and faith based organizations to enhance the provision of health care.

B.   Gifts-in-Kind
More than $5 million worth of supplies and medicines has been distributed to local health facilities and survivors living in tent cities. These include three Interagency Emergency Health Kits, one Interagency Diarrheal Kit, orthopedic equipment and supplies, suture materials and a broad range of medicines, including antibiotics.  The health facilities that received Gift-in-Kind medicines and supplies from MTI include King’s Hospital, Haiti Community Hospital, University of Miami Hospital, General Hospital, St. Damien’s Hospital, USS Comfort, Hospital at Bonne Fin, Centre Lumiere, Double Harvest Hospital, and Haiti Foundation of Hope.

C.  Rehabilitation of Health Infrastructure
The earthquake damaged many health care facilities in the affected areas. Medical Teams International met the needs of those injured and ill by: 
1.  Rehabilitating King’s Hospital, as well as providing the hospital with  medical staff, supplies, medicines and emergency orthopedic surgeries
2.  Deploying mobile medical units to various tent cities
3.  Supplying hospitals with urgently needed medicines and orthopedic supplies
4.  Transporting critically ill people to the U.S. for life-saving treatment","MTI calculates number of people reached by tracking patient charts, mobile clinic records, and clinic records.

Immediately after the January 12 earthquake SC began responding to the needs of earthquake-affected children and families, providing lifesaving relief and support to people in Port-au-Prince, Léogâne and Jacmel while continuing development programs in Port-au-Prince, Gonaïves, Maïssade, Dessalines, Jacmel and four border towns.

SC’s vision in Haiti is that the rights and needs of earthquake-affected children are met in ways that also develop the health, education, welfare and protection systems for all children in Haiti through direct program initiatives and advocacy for policy changes. Our goal is to work in areas where we can effectively support the most vulnerable children, their families, their communities and organizations that represent them (e.g., local NGOs).

Using a collaborative approach with the United Nations Protection Cluster, the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and Camp Management Agencies, USCRI helps internally displaced persons (IDPs) transition from camp-based assistance to achieving durable solutions through the following objectives:


Monitors the protection of displaced people before, during, and after movements from at risk sites designated for relocation to new emergency settlements. USCRI ensures that adequate information is shared with the population about conditions in the new site, provides recommendations for facilitating a smooth relocation process, and shares concerns or feedback from affected communities with United Nations agencies.  
Provides targeted assistance to especially vulnerable individuals (EVIs). USCRI identifies those with special needs in camps and host communities and develops case files to provide assistance to newly widowed mothers of small children, elderly persons abandoned by their families, unaccompanied children, and handicapped persons.
Expands the menu of durable solutions available to displaced people in at-risk sites.  USCRI informs displaced people of the five durable solutions available through the Government of Haiti Safe Shelter Strategy and identifies barriers keeping people from realizing their desired option. USCRI and GARR facilitate the movement of people to a sustainable destination of their choice and conduct follow up monitoring to ensure ongoing access to social services.
","USCRI has reached 50,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) with protection monitoring to ensure that the rights of those affected by the earthquake are being respected in the response and by all concerned authorities. USCRI has also provided 5,000 especially vulnerable individuals (EVIs) with targeted assistance in the form of shelter, medicine, food, water and sanitation interventions.

UNICEF’s role in emergencies is to focus on ensuring the survival, development, and protection of children.  The January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti was a ""children's emergency"": of more than two million people displaced by the earthquake, nearly one million are children.

In Haiti, UNICEF plays a major role in supporting water and sanitation, child protection, and health programs for displaced and vulnerable populations:
•   Water and Sanitation:  UNICEF is providing safe water to 333,000 people, and reaching 1.4 million people with a combination of services that include provision of safe drinking water, latrine construction, distribution of water purification tablets, and other hygiene and sanitation supplies.
•   Child Protection:  70,000 children benefit from recreational activities and other services in 310 Child-Friendly Spaces, with efforts transitioning from immediate post-disaster assistance to community awareness-raising on child protection.
•   Education:  UNICEF supplied more than 185,000 children with educational materials such as pens, pencils and notebooks , and provided 1,297 school tents for 155,000 learners.
•   Health:  UNICEF is providing breastfeeding and nutrition support and counseling to more than 23,000 mothers and their babies; and more than 275,000 children in 727 camps have been immunized against major vaccine-preventable diseases.
One of the most critical roles that UNICEF plays is acting as a coordinator of international actors in the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene; Education; and Nutrition Clusters.

A long-term micro-credit program (AC-LAM—Action Contre la Misère) provides loans to thousands of small entrepreneurs. Additionally, WC regularly assists in disaster preparation, mitigation and response, primarily with the repeated hurricanes.

World Concern’s specific response to the earthquake started with emergency distributions of food, water, essential non-food items, hygiene kits, medical supplies and emergency shelter. Additionally, we supplied fuel to hospitals in the first days after the quake to permit them to operate on emergency surgical cases.

Recovery response is ongoing. In Port-au-Prince this includes temporary shelter, cash for work, livelihood grants, micro-credit loan forgiveness and support to churches that have been damaged and that provide services to their communities. In Northwest, South and Southeast departments, this includes support to host family farmer and internally displaced persons (IDPs) through agricultural support and cash for work.","World Concern typically calculates the number of people reached at the household level.

Though World Neighbors’ program focus is on long-term rural development, due to the massive surge of people migrating into the rural program areas, there has been a significant need to address the short-term effects of this crisis as it has indirectly impacted on the more than 320 rural communities where we work. These immediate needs have included ensuring adequate supplies of food, clean water, shelter, sanitation and health services.

This objective is achieved primarily through the integration of comprehensive and holistic health, agriculture, shelter, and economic initiatives into the disaster recovery initiatives.

A common and chronic problem for communities in this region was scarcity of food, for a variety of reasons including poor crops and poorer market opportunities.

With over half a million displaced people now estimated to have left Port-au-Prince for the provinces, finding nutritious food will become even more of a problem. Many miles away from the epicenter, the earthquake’s impact is still felt, as the resources of communities are pushed to their limits. Recognizing the realities is the starting point to solving them. World Vision’s assessment results showed common pat-terns and priorities for displaced communities. Their needs and opinions have provided essential guidance for World Vision as they contribute to the recovery phase in Haiti.

The assessment showed that communities prioritize their own needs in the following order: 1) shelter, 2) food, 3) water, 4) health care, 5) income and 6) education and a future for children.

World Vision believes that lasting change is possible when our relief and development work is supported through advocacy, to open channels for justice and rights at household, community and government levels. For each sector where World Vision is working in Haiti, we are also calling for change from others. As we partner to rebuild Haiti, now is the time to create new opportunities.
