CartoDB offers a simple unified JavaScript library called CartoDB.js that lets you interact with the CartoDB service. This library allows you to connect to your stored visualizations, create new visualizations, add custom interaction, and access or query your raw data from a web browser; meaning, your applications just got a whole lot more powerful with a lot less code.

When you add CartoDB.js to your websites you get some great new tools to make maps or power your content with data. Let’s take a look.
