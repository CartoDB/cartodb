Here's your certificate "<%= certificate_name %>" to use CARTO’s Direct SQL Connection beta version.

You can use it with any application that supports SSL connections to PostgreSQL
with client identity verification to directly access and modify datasets stored in your CARTO account.

Two versions of the private key are provided:
* RSA PEM format (client.key)
* DER PKCS #8 format (client.key.pk8)
Depending on the connection method used by your application you should use one or another.
For example, connections with the PostgreSQL ODBC driver should use the RSA PEM format and
connections with the PostgreSQL JDBC driver should use the DER PKCS #8 format.

Contents:
* client.crt. Client certificate.
* client.key. Matching private key file in RSA PEM format. On UNIX-like systems (Linux, Mac OS, ...)
 this file should be protected with: `chmod 0600 client.key`.
* client.key.pk8. Matching private key file in DER PKCS #8 format.
* server_ca.pem. This certificate allows you to check the identity of CARTO's database server.

You'll need to configure your application to use TLS with client.key and client.crt
(and optionally server_ca.pem) when connecting to your database.

Your database address (host server) is: <%= dbproxy_host %>
And the TCP port is: <%= dbproxy_port %>

You should use your CARTO account user name (<%= username %>) as your database user (role),
and an API Key as your password. You can generate API Keys from your CARTO account dashboard
(‘API Keys’ section under your user profile on the top right of the screen).
The API key you use will determine which operations can be performed and which tables are accessible.
We advise you to generate specific keys and not to use your master API key.
We advise against exposing your Master API Key since it allows unrestricted access to your database.

Example: connect using psql:
 psql "sslmode=verify-full sslrootcert=server_ca.pem \
     sslcert=client.crt sslkey=client.key \
     hostaddr=<%= dbproxy_host %> \
     port=<%= dbproxy_port %> \
     user=<%= username %>"

Please note that this feature is a beta version still undergoing testing before an official release.
