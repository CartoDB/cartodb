Testing CartoDB
===============

Easy way
--------

Just run "make check". 

Detailed way
------------

CartoDB tests are based on [Ruby Spec](http://rspec.info/).
The procedure to run them is as follows:

  # Prepare test database
  bundle exec rake cartodb:test:prepare

  # Run all specs
  bundle exec rspec

If you want to run specific tests, rather than all of them, you
can specify them on the `rspec` command line, like:

  bundle exec spec/lib/sql_test_spec.rb

Troubleshooting
---------------

Common system configuration issues are reported in this section.

 - "No such user: test_cartodb_user_###" 

   Make sure test.port in config/database.yml is not pointing to
   pg_bouncer, as dynamically created database roles aren't easily
   supported by it (you'd need to explicitly list allowed usernames,
   and over 70 new users are created during a full testsuite run).

Speeding up test runs
---------------------

CartoDB is a large app.
We recommend you use the [spin gem](https://github.com/jstorimer/spin/)
to load the main application into memory while you are testing.
