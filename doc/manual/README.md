### How to contribute

Documentaiton uses Sphinx, an easy way to create structured documentation based on rst. Start with
this [tutorial](http://sphinx-doc.org/tutorial.html)

**Why not markdown?**

markdown is nice but rst has the same features, it's really similar but allow to have cross
references. It also allow to use Sphinx which create TOC, generate different formats (pdf, epub) and
allow to change themes.
