sass_dir = 'tmp/sass/editor'
images_dir = 'app/assets/images/'
# javascripts_dir = "lib/assets/javascripts"

# You can select your preferred output style here (can be overridden via the command line):

# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:
relative_assets = true

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:

# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass sass scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
