Here's your certificate "<%= certificate_name %>" to use the CARTO Direct SQL BETA service.

You can use it with any application that supports TSL/SSL connections to PostgreSQL
to directly access and modify your CARTO datasets.

Contents:

* client.key This file contains your private key that is needed to encrypt the connections.
  You must keep this file safely, as any one that gets access to this file may impersonate
  you and access your data. On UNIX-like systems (Linux, Mac OS, ...) this file should be
  protected with: `chmod 0600 client.key`.
* client.crt This is the certificate matching private key which will identify you
  when you connect to your CARTO database. Keep this also safely.
* server_ca.pem This is optional and allows you to check the identity of CARTO's database server.

You'll need to configure your application to use TSL with client.key and client.crt
(and optionally server_ca.pem) when connecting to your database.

Your database address (host server) is: <%= dbproxy_host %>
And the TCP port is: <%= dbproxy_port %>

You should use your CARTO account user name (<%= username %>) as your database user (role),
and an API Key as your password. You can generate API Keys from CARTO dashboard. The API Key you use
will determine which operations can be performed and which tables are accessible. We advise you
to generate specific keys and not use your master key, since the master key should be exposed as
little as possible, and it allows unrestricted access to your database.

Example: connect using psql:

  psql "sslmode=verify-ca sslrootcert=server_ca.pem \
      sslcert=client.crt sslkey=client.key \
      hostaddr=<%= dbproxy_host %> \
      port=<%= dbproxy_port %> \
      user=<%= username %>

This feature is in BETA. We'll provide more detailed information and guidelines very soon.

Please contact CARTO support for further information.
