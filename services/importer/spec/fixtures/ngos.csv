• Support those affected by the earthquake with immediate shelter and in their choice of shelter, transitioning to a durable solution, including building back safer, reducing vulnerability to natural disasters. 
• Support those affected by the earthquake in meeting water, sanitation and hygiene needs. 
• Support affected families in non-urban areas (including internally displaced persons (IDP) host families) to ensure that sufficient food is locally produced to avoid widespread food insecurity and minimize early return of IDPs to quake-affected urban areas. 
• Support women to access comprehensive quality health and protection services. 
• Contribute to promote and accelerate the re-schooling and psychosocial well-being of earth-quake-affected children.

Since then, we have expanded in size to reach more than 130 million people in more than 100 countries on five continents. 

Our mission is to assist impoverished and disadvantaged people overseas, working in the spirit of Catholic Social Teaching to promote the sacredness of human life and the dignity of the human person. Although our mission is rooted in the Catholic faith, our operations serve people based solely on need, regardless of their race, religion or ethnicity. Within the United States, CRS engages Catholics to live their faith in solidarity with the poor and suffering of the world. 

The fundamental motivating force in all activities of CRS is the Gospel of Jesus Christ as it pertains to the alleviation of human suffering, the development of people, and the fostering of charity and justice. We are committed to a set of Guiding Principles and hold ourselves accountable for them. 

As the official international humanitarian agency of the Catholic community in the United States, CRS is governed by a Board of Directors made up of clergy, most of them bishops, religious and Catholic lay men and women. 

CRS maintains strict standards of efficiency, accountability and transparency. Last year, more than 94 percent of revenues we spent went directly to programs that benefit the poor overseas.","Catholic Relief Services (CRS) has developed a comprehensive, long-term response to adjust ongoing programming based on the earthquake and to help those most affected by the disaster to rebuild their lives and communities. This strategy frames the relief and development interventions as well as approaches to engage the Catholic constituency in the US in the Haitian journey to recovery. 

Leadership development, protection, disaster risk reduction, advocacy and accountability are critical programming considerations with specific activities threaded throughout each sector.  

CRS and partners mobilized within hours of the disaster to assess needs and provide relief.  Since those early days, CRS has expanded in order to reach more people, and to strengthen programs in a variety of sectors.

"Christian Reformed World Relief Committee (CRWRC)","http://www.crwrc.org","The Christian Reformed World Relief Committee (CRWRC) is the relief and development arm of the Christian Reformed Church. CRWRC reaches out in God's name to people, both in North America and around the world, who are struggling with poverty, hunger, disaster, and injustice to help them find lasting ways to improve their lives. 

CRWRC works in cooperation with local and international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in order to respond quickly and effectively to the urgent needs of a community. Local expertise and knowledge provided by partners is invaluable to the work of CRWRC, especially where there are no ongoing CRWRC community development projects.  

CRWRC receives significant financial support through its membership in the Canadian Foodgrains Bank (CFGB) and from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). 

One aspect of this ministry is community development. In this ministry, CRWRC's staff members engage in community transformation in 30 countries around the world. They partner with more than 130 churches and community organizations to train local people to be leaders in their own communities. Together, CRWRC and these partners help people work together to overcome illiteracy, hunger, malnutrition, unemployment, HIV/AIDS, child mortality, injustice, and other issues affecting them. 

Another aspect of CRWRC's ministry is relief and disaster response. When disasters strike, CRWRC responds to the urgent needs that arise. In North America, this often includes clearing debris, assessing needs, training local leaders, and repairing and rebuilding damaged homes. Internationally, it includes providing and distributing emergency food, water, shelter, and other supplies. It also often involves reconstruction of homes and livelihoods. 

The third aspect of CRWRC's ministry involves working with people in North America and around the world to connect them to ministry, deepen their understanding of global issues, and encourage them to act and advocate on behalf of those in need. 

CRWRC depends on the regular financial support of God’s people.","We have completed the emergency phase of our response, and are now focusing on transitional housing, education, water and sanitation, housing repairs and permanent housing.

Recognized for our 99% efficiency rating, we respond to the needs of those we serve by providing medicines, preventing disease, and promoting health to create real hope and lasting change.

Founded in 1954, MAP International is one of the nation’s 100 largest nonprofit organizations, serving
25 million people annually in 115 countries. To date, we have provided nearly $4 billion in medicines and medical supplies globally. Our programs improve health and eliminate sickness and disease by increasing access to medicines and clean water, improving health services for mothers and children, educating families about tropical diseases, HIV/AIDS, and other health threats, and supporting community-led health development.

In times of disaster, MAP International provides immediate humanitarian assistance and relief aid including medicines and health care supplies to people left homeless and without access to basic services.  From the earliest days of a response, we also begin to focus on helping communities restore and rebuild health systems and lay the groundwork for long-term health development activities.","With an extensive network of medical partnerships and 40 years of service in Haiti, MAP International quickly assembled a response to the earthquake. Our first response was to send medical aid shipments to NGO partners with linkages to existing health networks and in-country capacity for warehousing and logistics, and who had mobilized field hospitals and clinics to triage the injured and provide other types of assistance. As needs shifted, these partners then switched their focus to post-operative care, infections of untreated wounds, diseases of crowded conditions, and ongoing healthcare needs. In the long term, MAP is pursuing the support to recover the government healthcare system, strengthen rehabilitation activities, and develop programs that lead toward Total Health Villages. ","The number of beneficiaries was estimated by the number of treatments projected from medical shipments in all phases of the Haiti Relief effort.  A reasonable assumption is made that each patient on the average requires three different treatments.  In the past, MAP had conducted an assessment of all medical shipments and arrived at an estimated number of treatments in each type of delivery method (palletized shipments & MAP Travel Packs).  This number of treatments is an estimate only from a sampling of past shipments – the actual number of treatments for each shipment may vary considerably since the contents of the shipments also varies, depending on availability of specific medicines and supplies.  

It would not be feasible to calculate actual numbers of persons treated in a relief effort, so the average number of treatments per individual is used as a proxy for beneficiary numbers.  It would be especially difficult to calculate unduplicated beneficiary numbers (if the same patient returned for multiple treatment visits).  A detailed patient record-keeping system would be required (not feasible in a relief situation) to identify.

Effective Spending: PDT's research projects increase the effectiveness of development assistance by providing international organizations with new data on the local impact of their missions.  This helps inform better decision-making that leads to smarter spending. 
 
Equitable Peace Dividend: Through a unique set of services, PDT's economic recovery projects encourage the international community in post-conflict countries to use locally available goods and services to carry out their operations.  This in turn creates jobs, generates important tax revenue and develops the local marketplace - all of which support peace and long-term stability.
","Since 2009, PDT has operated the Peace Dividend Marketplace - Haiti project to streamline the international community’s local procurement activities. The objective is to help create jobs and inspire long-term economic growth and stability by encouraging the international community to use locally available goods and services.

","PDT measures ‘people reached’ in a number of ways
• Peace Dividend Trust’s Business Portal, http://www.haiti.buildmarkets.org contains an online directory that lists comprehensive profiles of all businesses that have remained operational since the aftermath of the earthquake in January 2010. 
• Currently, the business directory lists 1500 Businesses that have been registered and verified by our team as Haitian owned or operated, as per our supplier registration standards. Of this, approximately 350 businesses are female-owned or managed (i.e., roughly 25%).
• The directory allows potential buyers to search business profiles by sector and location. The Business Portal also contains a tender directory where suppliers can access new business opportunities and relevant research on the Haitian marketplace. 
• By connecting international buyers to local suppliers, PDM-H’s activities have contributed to Haiti’s economic recovery since the earthquake by increasing levels of local procurement and including the private sector in the international assistance effort. This has largely been operationalized under our “Buy local. Build Haiti” strategy.

Established in 1984 to meet the holistic needs of the rural people of the Dominican Republic, Plant With Purpose now works around the world, including programs in Haiti, Mexico, Northern Thailand, Tanzania and Burundi to address and reverse poverty and deforestation.

Plant With Purpose’s programs uniquely combine personal transformation, economic renewal and environmental restoration to bring hope and dignity to the rural poor. Its programs are comprised of four inter-locking elements designed to promote self-sufficiency and responsible environmental stewardship: 

We teach poor farmers to solve their own problems through community development, emphasizing long-term development rather than handouts. 
We plant innovative, mutually beneficial agroforestry systems that restore the land while providing farmers with abundant harvests. 
We create healthier, sustainable economies through micro-enterprise credit cooperatives. 
We share the gospel through long-term relation-ships focused on discipleship and servant leader-ship. However, the love and opportunities we share are unconditional; participation in Plant With Purpose’s spiritual activities is in no way a requirement for receiving our services. 

By teaching sustainable agriculture, granting access to credit and empowering communities to take ownership of their problems and work collectively to implement creative solutions, Plant With Purpose equips farmers with the tools to lift themselves out of poverty, become self-sufficient and transform their lives and land.","Plant With Purpose USA, through its local partner Floresta Haiti, helps rural communities improve their environmental and economic situations by providing training and support for savings and loans groups, and by building better relationships in communities.","For the purposes of this mapping initiative we are reporting only direct participants in the program activities.",1000000,"100%","0%",1000000,"100%","0%",,,,,,43,"Bob Morikawa","Technical Director","(416)-724-2441","robertmorikawa@gmail.com","Kate Nare","Marketing Coordinator","(858)-274-3718","kate@plantwithpurpose.org","858-274-3718","4903 Morena Blvd. Suite 1215",,"San Diego","CA","92117","http://www.plantwithpurpose.org"

"World Neighbors","http://www.wn.org","World Neighbors is an international development organization that has been working in the developing world since 1951, striving to eliminate hunger, poverty and disease in the most deprived rural villages in Asia, Africa and Latin America. World Neighbors employs a holistic, people-centered approach to rural development, and invests in people and their communities by training and inspiring them to create their own solutions through programs that address sustainable agriculture, livelihoods, community and reproductive health and environmental management and protection.","World Neighbors’ work in Haiti dates back to 1966. The earthquake impacted rural communities in all of our 11 program areas, all located north of Port-au-Prince. 
Though World Neighbors’ program focus is on long-term rural development, due to the massive surge of people migrating into the rural program areas, there has been a significant need to address the short-term effects of this crisis as it has indirectly impacted on the more than 320 rural communities where we work. These immediate needs have included ensuring adequate supplies of food, clean water, shelter, sanitation and health services. 
Contributions to the World Neighbors Haiti Fund are designated in support of both short-term needs and the longer-term development programs benefiting more than 320 rural villages.","In Haiti, World Neighbors works directly with eleven (11) community-based organizations (CBOs) – one in each of our 11 program areas. The estimated number of people reached in each community is consolidated by CBO representatives through monthly reporting meetings held at the community level. These estimates are then passed on to World Neighbors staff on a monthly and/or quarterly basis. Data collected include the following: No. of communities; No. of households reached; No of participants (involved in program activities); No. of beneficiaries; and No. of volunteers (i.e., community-level volunteer leaders facilitating local activities).",535740,"66%","34%",470008,"80%","20%",,,,,,12,"Christopher Price","Vice President, Field Support","(800)-242-6387","cprice@wn.org","Erin Engelke","Vice President Marketing & Communications","(405)-418-0398","eengelke@wn.org","405-752-9700","4127 NW 122nd Street",,"Oklahoma City","OK","73120","http://wn.org"
"World Relief","http://wr.org","Founded in 1944 as the humanitarian arm of the National Association of Evangelicals, World Relief (WR) works alongside local churches and communities on four continents to serve the most vulnerable. WR extends its reach into many of the poorest and least developed nations on earth, focusing on microfinance, HIV/AIDS prevention and care, maternal and child health, child development, agricultural training, disaster response, refugee resettlement and immigrant services. WR is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, and has offices around the world.","World Relief has been working in Haiti since 1993. Before the earthquake, WR focused its efforts on health, including HIV/AIDS, maternal and child Health, and orphans and vulnerable children. WR also worked with a partner organization, World Concern, to create a microfinance institution called Action Contre La Misere. 

Post-earthquake, World Relief aims to leverage its emergency response towards long-term, sustainable development where families and communities are able to live better lives than before the tragedy. Families will not only have new homes, access to clean water, and community health support, but also the opportunity to join agriculture initiatives that provide entirely new livelihoods – which are supported by new credit mechanisms and linkages to local and regional markets.","World Relief Haiti usually calculates the number of people reached at the household level.

With over half a million displaced people now estimated to have left Port-au-Prince for the provinces, finding nutritious food will be even more of a problem. A World Vision assessment showed that the priority needs of displaced communities, in order, are: shelter, food, water, healthcare, income, and education and a future for children.
