### Issues on Github

If you think you may have found a bug, or if you have a feature request that you would like to share with the Federated Tables API team, please [open an issue](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/issues/new). 

Before opening an issue, review the [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/CartoDB/cartodb/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Community support on GIS Stack Exchange

GIS Stack Exchange is the most popular community in the geospatial industry. This is a collaboratively-edited question and answer site for geospatial programmers and technicians. It is a fantastic resource for asking technical questions about developing and maintaining your application.


When posting a new question, please consider the following:

* Read the GIS Stack Exchange [help](https://gis.stackexchange.com/help) and [how to ask](https://gis.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) pages for guidelines and tips about posting questions.
* Be very clear about your question in the subject. A clear explanation helps those trying to answer your question, as well as those who may be looking for information in the future.
* Be informative in your post. Details, code snippets, logs, screenshots, etc. help others to understand your problem.
* Use code that demonstrates the problem. It is very hard to debug errors without sample code to reproduce the problem.

### Engine Plan Customers

Engine Plan customers have additional support options beyond general community support. As per your account Terms of Service, you have access to enterprise-level support through CARTO's support representatives available at [enterprise-support@carto.com](mailto:enterprise-support@carto.com)

In order to speed up the resolution of your issue, provide as much information as possible (even if it is a link from community support). This allows our engineers to investigate your problem as soon as possible.

If you are not yet CARTO customer, browse our [plans & pricing](https://carto.com/pricing/) and find the right plan for you.
