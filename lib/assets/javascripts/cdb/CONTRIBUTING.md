### CartoDB.js quick start

This is a little doc with the basis of CartoDB.js framework (TM), in other words, all you need to know to start workig with it wihout doing it wrong.

#### general info
 - The framework(TM) is built on top of Backbone.js (so you can use jQuery and underscore everywhere).
 - we use jasmine for testing (```grunt test```)
 - cdb is the namespace, so all the components should be inside it, i.e cbd.geo.Map. (look into cartodb.js)
 - code style guide: https://github.com/cartodb/cartodb/wiki/Javascript-style-guide

#### folders
 - cartodb.js: this file contains the scopes for all the app, should be included first
 - core
 - geo
 - lib
 - test
 - examples

#### core

This contains all the base classes, used in all the project:

 - config: all the app config goes here. Accesible by cdb.config
 - logging: never ever use console.log, use cbd.log.info, cdb.log.error and cdb.debug. error call will generate an error  You can check errors with cbd.errors singleton (it is a backbone.Collection)
 - view: DO NOT USE Backbone.View, use cbd.core.View instead. It tracks zombie views and make removing views safe.
 - templates


#### general guidelines for views

- never ever change a view directly. For example a button that changes the state should change the model and the view should change when the models triggers the change event.

- call clean when your view will not be used anymore

- link model events in this way, even if you have binded the method. Notice the 3rd parameter (this)

  ·this.model.bind('change', this.callback, this);

- when you have to unlink the view from the model you can do:

  · this.model.unbind(null, null, this);

- if your view has model and listen events from it, add to realted models (will be free when you call clean):

  // inside the view
  this.add_related_model(this.whatevermodel);
